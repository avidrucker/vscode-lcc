# Contributing to LCC-Tools for VSCode

Requirements: VS Code is required to debug and test this extension.

## How to download extension locally from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lettucegoblin/vscode-lcc.git
```

## How to start testing extension locally

1. Disable LCC-Tools extension if you have it installed already
    a. Click on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar (shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X)
    b. Type LCC in the search bar
    c. Under LCC-Tools by Lettuce, first click on the gear icon, then select "Disable", and then lastly click on the "Restart Extensions" button that appears to the left of the gear icon

2. Open the extension code locally
    a. Fork and clone the "vscode-lcc" repo (you only need to do this once)
    b. Make sure your "main" branch is up-to-date with the latest "main" branch here: https://github.com/lettucegoblin/vscode-lcc (this is recommended to do each time)
    c. Navigate to where you have cloned the "vscode-lcc" repo
    d. Open with VSCode either via the command line with `code .` or from VSCode itself with "Open Folder"

3. Run and debug locally via VS Code
    a. Click on the "Run and Debug" icon on the left sidebar (shotcut Ctrl+Shift+D)
    b. Click on the green triangle icon "Start Debugging" button at the top of the sidebar. A new VSCode window will open up.
    c. In the newly opened VSCode window, navigate to a file with Machine Code or Assembly code to inspect how the extension is behaving.
    d. After making any changes to the extension code (ideally on a new test branch), either press the green circular arrow "Restart" icon (Ctrl+Shift+F5) or, if this icon is not showing as it sometimes does, simply press the red "Stop" icon and press the green "Start" button again

4. Commit changes often with clear commit messages. Starting your commit messages with "fix" (for bugs) or "feat" (for new features), for example, will help make your commit messages clearer.

5. When you are ready, merge your changes with your main branch, push your changes to your remote fork, and open a pull request against the main branch at https://github.com/lettucegoblin/vscode-lcc
