    c. Under LCC-Tools by Lettuce, first click on the gear icon, then select "Disable", and then lastly click on the "Restart Extensions" button that appears to the left of the gear icon

2. Open the extension code locally
    a. Navigate to where you have cloned the "vscode-lcc" repo
    b. Open with VSCode either via the command line with `code .` or from VSCode itself with "Open Folder"

3. Run and debug locally via VS Code
    a. Click on the "Run and Debug" icon on the left sidebar (shotcut Ctrl+Shift+D)
    b. Click on the green triangle icon "Start Debugging" button at the top of the sidebar. A new VSCode window will open up.

    d. After making any changes to the extension code (ideally on a new test branch), either press the green circular arrow "Restart" icon (Ctrl+Shift+F5) or, if this icon is not showing as it sometimes does, simply press the red "Stop" icon and press the green "Start" button again
